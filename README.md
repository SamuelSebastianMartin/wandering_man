Practice using event listeners to move around the canvas

This is just a nonsense script to practice moving a rectangle within the bounds of a square.

Key events are managed via an array, so multiple key-down events can be handled. For example, pushing up and left at the same time moves the man diagonally.

Possible extension
------------------

It would be nice if the man shrank as he approached some horizon line, to give a sense of perspective.
This would be better with a Person class, perhaps, so size can be controlled by a method.
